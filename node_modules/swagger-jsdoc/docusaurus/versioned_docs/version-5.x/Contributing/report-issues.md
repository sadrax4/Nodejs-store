### Reporting issues

Before submitting new issues, please make sure you first search for existing such. It is quite possible that the topic you would like to bring up has been discussed already.

In case of an issue which hasn't been considered yet, please include as much information as possible about the issue. This will help maintainers and other users relate to your problem at hand.

For instance:

- Describe what you were doing when the issue appeared.
- Add a set of steps to reproduce your issue.
- Include screenshots.
- Give examples on expected vs actual behavior.
